Part 1: [Scale your system Part 1 (From 1 to 10 000 users)]({% post_url 2019-08-03-scaling-1-to-10-000-users %})
 
We are unto the 2<sup>nd</sup> part. How do we continue scaling from 10 000 users onwards?

## Stage 4: 99 000 active users

Now it might be time for a **CDN** and for a **Stateless architecture**.

What can be gained by using a CDN?

CDNs offer a network of geographically dispersed servers. The physically servers are closer to your users, which shortens latency. CDNs usually serve only static resources: images, css, javascript, ..., but there are also some dynamic content serving CDN services.

CDNs make sure that when a user connects to a website, the closest and the best performing serever will deliver the static resources for this website.

CDNs also perform caching, which means their content might not always be up to date or alternatively, the CDN server might initially not have the requested resource stored locally and would need to first request it from an app server.

Will be continued....
