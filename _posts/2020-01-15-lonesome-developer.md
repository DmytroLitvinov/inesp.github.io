The first person to walk on the Moon was Neil Armstrong. I knew this even before I knew how to speak English or knew how to spell his name. Why did the 8 year old me know this? Why do we need a frontman for everything? And how do you build a team in such a culture?

## Are you a team player?

Have you ever been asked this question? There are ethiquette rules determining how to asnwer it. We are not supposed to just wing it, we are supposed to know the answer by heart. You first firmly say *"yes"* and then add a vague, but believable proof of your ability to perform exeptionally inside a team. There are a milion articles on the internet explaining how to answer in a sofisticated, educated way, without really revealing anything personal. 

![Google search: are you a team player](/assets/frontman-team-player.jpg)

These articles generally do not criticize the question, but they also do not encourage their readers to be sincere when answering. Maybe they consider the people asking this question to be so out of sync with reality that they will not notice they received no answer. And maybe they are right. This question has no point. 

Humans are social beings. Except a few jackasses, psychopaths and narcissists, the rest of us would love being the most amazing team player. But, are you sure you will reward us if we decide that the team is more important and our own success?

## Who is rewarded in your company?

A few years ago, I was assigned to a new team at a new company. There were 4 of us and initially, we had few problems working together. As with any new team, we spent the first few months getting to know each other and accomodating each other's ways of working. But soon it became obvious, that while 3 of us have managed to adjust to life in this new team, one of us couldn't. One of us would repeatedly come into conflict with one or the other team member. But because managing people is complicated and not being thought enough it took the team's manager one year to decide to interfere. What is more, the intervention came in the form of a promotion. This person, who made 3 other people suffer for a year and was eroding away their motivation to work, to produce, was given a new title and his own team. True, it was a team of 1, but it was a promotion nevertheless. 

Don't get me wrong, the 3 of us were very pleased with our team's shrinkage. We became more connected, more motivated and more happy. But, looking at the effect on the whole company, such promotions very effectively undermine teamwork. On the one hand, they set the precedence that being a jackass will open up doors for you. On the other, they beg the question, have the managers in this company been promoted to their current positions, because they are good managers or because there is a team of 3 people somewhere, who just weren't able to work with this person anymore? 

## The biggest detriment to team work

Managers guide and determine the culture in your company. Like it or not, managers act like referees in your teams. They decide, what to praise and what to criticize. On the larger scale, with promotions and firings, and also on the small scale with everyday comments or the lack of them. If somebody is undermining a team and the manager does nothing about it, this manager will be seen as incompetent.

Contrary to how Holywood often depicts bosses, people do not perform best in hostile environments. We perform best in phychologically safe environments. 

In hostile environments actions are expensive, one wrong step can mean you are going to be publicly attacked, ridiculed and insulted. Creativity is thus thrown out of the window, taking risks becomes a stupid thing to do and teamwork is dead. 

The researchers W. Felps, T. Mitchell and E. Byington have researched the effect of having a bad apple in a team and found that this dramatically deminishes the team's output. Dealing with conflicts that arise 

> consumes inordinate amounts of time, psychological resources, and emotional energy

The behavior of the negative members undermines *"perceptions of equity, mood, and trust"*. The researches C. Pearson, L.Andersson and C.Porath have concluded that 

> More than one-third of [the people surveyed] reported that they intentionally reduced their commitment to the organization as a result of being a target of uncivil behavior. They disengaged from tasks and activities that went beyond their job specifications. Through all phases of our study, people told us that after being targets they ceased voluntary efforts. Some stopped helping newcomers, others stopped offering assistance to colleagues. Additionally, targets reduced their contributions to the organization as a whole, whether by pulling themselves off of task forces and committees, or by reducing efforts to generate or inspire innovation. 
>
> Nearly one-fourth of [the people surveyed] admitted that they intentionally decreased work efforts [..]. They stopped doing their best. Some also purposefully decreased the amount of time they spent at work.


* But not with the whole team, just with the troublemaker(s).
where we can experiment, be creative, take risks and stil know we will not be punished if we do not succeed.. People are like orchids. 

## Goals determine the 

Do you have personal OKRs in your company or personal quarterly goals or monthly bonuses. 


A manager has a huge amount of influencce. Managers determine culture. Because they are the judjes of what is or isnt appropriate behaviour.

What I want to say: 
- we are obsessed with frontmans. Children learn the names of great people in the past, nothing else about these people, just that they singlehandedl did great. Look at Edison for example, he had a company of X employees, but what I learned is that he singlehandedly invented 100 inventios. That he was super smart, smarter than any other person in hystory, for he invented 100 things. 
So... what do you expect me to strive for? Should I focus on supporting other people or should I try to be the one, the great, the magnificent?

Look at the bonuses logic. We have figured out hot to determine your worth, says some company owner somewhere. You are worth exactly 10% of the price of every object, a customer buys from me and you happen to have been the nearest stuff. Everybody gets a bonus, if they have fullfilled thier goals for this quarter. Have you ever checked what kind of goal are being set? Has anybody ever set the goal to be nice to your team-mates? Or to help them finish their goals? How do you imagine this playing out? I give 3 people separate goals (all a bit too high) and this will make them work together more. Yes, a logical conclussion.
You know how to build propper team spirit? You start with children, you put an emphasis on self-lessness AND you reward selflessness. 
Here is a children's play from the amazon?

How did we become so obsessed with individual contributors? The first perosn to do this to do that. I am 100% sure that no person has ever achieved anything worthwile alone. On some level we agree with this, but the next moment we turn around and praise the One, the Mighty, the Great. It didn't use to be this way.
