Hi, my name is Ines Panker and above all, I am an inquisitive person. The more I know, the more I understand.

At work, I always end up being the designated fixer. Mostly because I like to help and because I have perfected an awesome technique for problem-solving over the years. If it is a bug, we are trying to get rid of, then all it takes is a minute or two of stern-looking at it. This has almost always revealed the true culprit of the problem. If it is a process, we are missing, then a half-hour stern looking at it should help. And if it is a person, who is causing trouble, then a gentler, kinder approach stretched out over a few months should do the trick. 99.9% of problems are solvable and most of them end with a better outcome than we anticipated.

I have done all sorts of things through the years, I practised fencing and aikido and even rhythmic gymnastics when I was little, I have been known to write poems and poetic literature and to be skilled at drawing. At one point or another, I knew (or still know) how to speak Latin, Spanish, Japanese, French, German and English. When I was little, I wanted to be either a hair-dresser or a seamstress. When I was a bit older but still little, I wanted to be an archaeologist, but I soon became convinced everything has already been discovered, thus I decided to pursue that profession only by becoming all-knowledgeable about history.

A huge reason I ended up in the software engineering world is because of a test for figuring out what I should study, which said I should be a designer of web pages. I didn't even know such a person existed. Admittedly, this was the 3rd test I took, I didn't like the results of the first two, so ..I kept going :). Maybe I knew what I wanted all along and I was just looking for encouragement. I am happy, though, I ended up in Software. But it has never stopped me from dabbling in other fields in my spare time.
